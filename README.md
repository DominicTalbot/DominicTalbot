# Hi, I'm Dominic üëã

## About Me

I'm a digital engineer with a diverse background in software development and technical solutions. My career began in IT support for local government, where I developed tools like e-forms to streamline workflows. I then transitioned into CRM development at TOR Systems, contributing to projects in the visitor attraction industry by designing email templates, campaign wizards, and analytics tools.

Alongside my professional work, I have a passion for game dev, having worked with Unity, C#, and Maya for 3D modeling. These experiences taught me to combine technical precision with creativity. Nowadays, I‚Äôm focused on full-stack web development, creating applications using React, Node.js, and modern web technologies. Currently, I‚Äôm building a React Admin website and a portfolio website to showcase my skills and projects. üöÄ

I thrive on solving complex problems, learning new technologies, and building tools that make a real impact.
